# 🧾 Task 7 - Basic Sales Summary using SQLite & Python

## 📌 Overview

In this task, we were asked to create a basic sales summary from a small dataset (initially envisioned for a SQLite database) using SQL-like operations within Python. The task focused on:
- Loading or accessing sales data
- Summarizing sales to find total items sold and total revenue per product
- Displaying the results using print statements and a bar chart

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `date`: The date of the sales transaction.
- `product id`: A unique identifier for each product.
- `city id`: A unique identifier for the city where the sale occurred.
- `orders`: The number of units of the product ordered in the transaction.
- `price inr`: The price of one unit of the product in Indian Rupees (INR).

The data was likely provided in a pandas DataFrame or could be loaded from a CSV file.

## 🔍 Analysis and Findings

The primary goal was to determine the total number of items sold and the total revenue generated by each product. This was achieved by grouping the data by `product id` and then calculating the sum of `orders` and `price inr` for each product. The results were then ordered by the total revenue in descending order to identify the top-performing products.

**SQL-like Operation (using Pandas):**

```python
import pandas as pd

# df = pd.read_csv('your_sales_data.csv')

product_summary = df.groupby('product id').agg(
    total_items_sold=('orders', 'sum'),
    total_revenue=('price inr', 'sum')
).sort_values(by='total_revenue', ascending=False)

print("Basic Sales Summary by Product:")
print(product_summary.head())
